basic rpg


Hey everyone, I am feeling pretty excited about this game; I hope that whoever joins this effort will be motivated towards accomplishing a 
major coding achievement and milestone!

This is my first game project; I mostly watch other people play games or play some myself, but from a man named Sean Plott (Day9tv) I got
the inspiration needed to start my own game, through his playthroughs of Titan Souls, a brilliantly made platformer that has
a beautiful storyline and general plot and gameplay options and elements. When I noticed how awesome that game was, I thought to myself, 
well, I guess I'll try to make my own game! 

I mean, even if it doesn't turn out too well in the beginning, we can still improve and keep working on it until it looks and feels
like a real rpg! (yeah it's a top-down rpg)


So that was an inspirational speech in some way, I just wanted to give some background to this. 

I will continue working on this project; I should probably upload a storyline and some general plot elements in the future. 


Thanks for supporting this endeavor!
